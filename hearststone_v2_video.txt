Create a cozy, animated sequence set on a rustic tabletop. The camera slowly pans over a collection of detailed, hand-stitched fabric patches, each representing a different Hearthstone class or theme â€” swirling arcane magic, a glowing frost skull, a playful frog, a mighty axe, and the iconic Darkmoon Faire ticket. Soft ambient music plays in the background, with subtle animations: the swirl glows and spins gently, lightning flickers around the staff, the axe glints in candlelight, the frog winks, and the moon on the ticket pulses. The scene ends with the Hearthstone logo subtly embroidered across the screen as if being stitched live.
