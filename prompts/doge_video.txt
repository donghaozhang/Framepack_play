The video opens in a warm, softly lit Japanese-style caf√©. Rain gently falls outside the window, casting reflections on the wooden floor. The camera slowly zooms in or pans to reveal Cheems, a lifelike Shiba Inu, dressed as a wandering samurai. He wears a traditional straw hat, a worn white cloak, and three katanas on his waist, referencing One Piece's Roronoa Zoro.
