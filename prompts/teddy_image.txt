A cinematic, atmospheric close-up shot parodying the iconic scene from The Avengers where Thanos gathers all five Infinity Stones and snaps his fingers. In this version, a slightly oversized teddy bear dressed in Thanos's costume performs the snap, creating a unique blend of power and contemplation while retaining the teddy bearâ€™s inherent cuteness.
