A double exposure image in the style of Yukisakura â€” a masterpiece featuring the silhouette of Arthas, the Lich King from the World of Warcraft series, using a stunning double exposure composition. The details are sharp, with intertwining cold elements extending across the vastness of Northrend. A wide-angle view of Frostmourne in hand is accented by Icecrown Citadel, creating a breathtaking effect. The glacial textures extend outward through the structure of the character, generating a beautiful tension, while the contrasting monochromatic background enhances the clarity of the striking double exposure effect. The artwork features vivid tones, sharp lines, and meticulously handled shadows in the character's silhouette (Detail: 1.45). (Background detail: 1.4)
