isometric cutaway 3D render of a coffee machine revealing a miniature morning train station inside — tiny commuters waiting at platforms, espresso trains moving on rail lines made of drip tubes, steam vents working like tunnels, coffee bean sacks stacked like luggage — soft light, high detail, stainless steel and glass textures, warm coffee tones and pastel accents, no yellow tint, clean and whimsical world inside a common machine
