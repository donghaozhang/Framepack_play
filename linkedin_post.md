☕ Coffee Machine Train Station
An isometric 3D cutaway rendering of a coffee machine reveals a miniature morning train station inside. Tiny commuters wait at platforms, espresso trains glide along rails made of drip tubes, steam vents function as tunnels, and coffee bean sacks are stacked like luggage—all brought to life with exquisite lighting and textures.​

🎴 Doraemon Pokémon Card
A hyper-realistic, holographic Pokémon-style trading card featuring Doraemon. The card showcases a Psychic-type icon, a playful and adventurous pose, and a shimmering rainbow and gold holofoil surface.​

🐕 Samurai Doge
A Shiba Inu dons traditional samurai attire, including a conical hat, white cape, and dual katanas. Set within a cozy Japanese-style interior, the scene is accentuated by rainy windows and warm lighting.​

❄️ Lich King
A striking double exposure image of Arthas, the Lich King from World of Warcraft. Intertwining cold elements extend across Northrend and Icecrown Citadel, creating a breathtaking visual effect.​

🧸 Thanos Teddy Bear
A cinematic, atmospheric shot parodying Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet. Here, a teddy bear dons Thanos's costume, blending power and cuteness in a unique composition.​

🧵 Hearthstone Patches
A set of six Hearthstone-themed embroidered patches, each displaying exquisite details and iconic textures on a fabric background. The designs feature various classes and themes from the popular game.​

🧠 About TeaCache
TeaCache is a caching mechanism designed to accelerate inference in diffusion models by reusing computations across timesteps. By monitoring changes in modulated inputs and utilizing a relative L1 distance threshold, TeaCache intelligently decides when to refresh the cache, balancing speed and output fidelity.​
