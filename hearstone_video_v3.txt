A slow, cinematic video showing six Hearthstone-themed embroidered patches laid out on a textured fabric canvas. The camera gently zooms in and pans across each patch one by one. First, the iconic Hearthstone swirl emblem glows with magical light. Then the warm, cozy inn scene with a flickering fireplace and a foaming mug animates slightly. Next, the explorer character lifts his torch, casting a warm orange glow. Coins fly out from a magical burst in the next patch, shimmering midair. The scroll slowly unfurls to reveal the mechanical gnome sketch. Finally, the legendary card back glows as if enchanted. Include subtle particle effects, thread shimmer, and soft ambient fantasy music in the background. Fabric background gently moves as if in a breeze.
